# Chicuelo-Mix

## Introduction
Chicuelo made a very elegant and polished theme for EmulationStation, aptly called Chicuelo. He has a very fine grip on colors and presentation (figures the man is a designer). I adore his theme specifically the contrast between plain background and exorbitant colors of flyers/ pictures, since I primarily use Attract-Mode I decided to port Chicuelo's theme to AM. 

All the credit for this theme (Chicuelo-Mix) goes to Chicuelo. Design decisions, artwork placement, font selection etc. were all made by him. To show my appreciation and respect to the original author I have tried my best to keep this theme as close to original as possible. Since EmulationStation and Attract-Mode are two different applications I had to tweak some things, a list of changes is listed under the differences header below.

**_Again to drive the point home, this here is merely a port of an excellent theme. The credit for this great theme rests solely with Chicuelo._**

* **Original Theme Thread:** https://retropie.org.uk/forum/topic/15830/chicuelo-theme
* **Original Theme (GitHub):** https://github.com/chicueloarcade/es-theme-Chicuelo   

Lastly I've found Attract-Mode forums to be very helpful, this here is my little bit of contribution to the community :)

## Features:
* Exceptionally fine tuned, elegant and polished theme
* Currently supports 1920x1080 (16:9) resolution, but easy to tweak to other resolutions since we deal with few artwork items. Also the dimensions are listed in plain numbers so upsizing/ downsizing won't be a huge problem.
* Lightweight, should work with most systems
* Highly customizable, just by changing the System pictures you can create a very different look. 
* Easy to expand: Easy to add more systems, all you will need are a few artwork items (provided emulation for that system works).

## Installation:
Attract-Mode is completely Portable. That means different Attract-Mode installations in different folders operate in isolation and don't affect each other. For this theme/ layout I HIGHLY recommend that you download and use a seperate version because **_WARNING!!!**_ If you copy the contents of this theme over an existing instance of Attract-Mode, some of your settings (including romlists) will be overwritten. This repo is made with new users in mind and tailored to keep things as simple as possible, so I have made some pre-configured files which WILL OVERWRITE old installation files. If you are familiar with Attract-Mode's working then only download /layout/Chicuelo Mix v1.x and place it in /layouts.

1. Download Attract-mode and Unzip. File is located here  
http://attractmode.org/download.html
2. (OPTIONAL) Keil's Shuffle module is already included in download.zip, if you are only downloading the layout part make sure to get it
https://github.com/keilmillerjr/shuffle-module and place it in /modules else skip this step.
3. Fetch the latest release candidate from the Github release page https://github.com/randombyt/Chicuelo-Mix. Extract it and paste the contents (6 folders and 6 files) on top of Attract-Mode folder, allow all overwrites. If you are only seeking the layout, download the release candidate, extract it and place "Chicuelo Mix" folder in /AM/layouts, this folder includes all artwork assets/ fonts etc. utilized in the theme. 
4. Start Attract-Mode, Press Tab for Settings. Change controls and restart.
5. Everything should be operational now as far as DisplaysMenu go.
6. Theme has two layout.nut files. To ensure the Games Lists screens properly display your collectionc go to AM > Settings > Displays > [System] > Layout Options and Select "layout_games"

## Controls:
1. Up/ Down: This is a layout with vertical flow, so selection in "DisplaysMenu" and "SystemMenu" is via up and down mapped on keyboard or gamepad.

2. Right/ Left: Right & Left are disabled on "DisplaysMenu" and only work in "SystemMenu" where they jump to the next display in same platform group. Right/ Left can be mapped to gamepad/ keyboard.

## Adding or Removing Systems/ Romslist:
1. If you want to add systems, then add an [emulator].cfg file in /emulators (examples are provided) just make sure that name of [emulator].cfg matches the System name in the theme (example genesis is named Sega Genesis in the theme and that is how you should name it). 
2. Then either generate a romlist from within Attrcat-Mode or use a pre-made romlists/ [emulator].cfg, rename them according to the theme and make sure you edit [Emulator] part of romlist to reflect the changes. 
3. Adding a new system requires adding a line in the relevant DisplaysMenu romlist. Console will be added to Consoles.txt, Arcades to Arcades.txt and so on. All systems from the original Chicuelo theme are included in the pre-made lists. If you want to add more systems ensure to follow the format of the systems in DisplaysMenu configs. A common mistake is not adding "@" in the Emulator field.
4. If you want to remove a system add a "#" before its related DisplayMenu.txt romlist. Example for removing Amiga (computer system) open Computers.txt in /romlists and place a hash (#) before its listing. Attract-Mode will no longer list it.
 
## Differences between Chicuelo (EmulationStation) and Chicuelo-Mix (Attract-Mode):
1. Added DisplaysMenu/ PlatformsMenu because calling some text assets would have required making direct enteries in layout.nut
2. Converted Logo SVG to PNG as Attract-Mode does not support SVG yet
3. Changed system names from abbreviated EmulationStation format to standard titles as Attract-Mode does not support ES' abbreviations directly.
4. Changed NeoGeo to SNK NeoGeo MVS, Changed PC/DOS to DOS
5. Cosmetic changes like animation effect on arrows & sounds while browsing

## Future Prospects:
* This theme will continue to mimic the original. Additions (if any) will not deviate from original. 
* Game list sizes at the moment have to be manually added and can't be called via layout, this will be updated once I figure out how to do it.
* Sounds are a bit of a mismatch, I might update them to get a more Arcade like feel.

## Credits:
### Theme
This theme was created solely by Chicuelo, I have merely ported the theme to Attract-Mode. All the credit goes to Chicuelo and huge thanks to him for sharing his great work with the community.

### General Attract-Mode Stuff:
Having no know how of squirrel language, I have relied extensively on knowledgeable members of Attract-Mode forums and picked a lot from their posts. Specially keilmillerjr, oomek, jedione, progets, hermine.potter, liquid8d, zpaolo11x, kent79, calle81 & qqplayer. I'm probably not remebering a lot of other names but thank you for all the help. 

### Plugins/ Modules
* Shuffle Plugin from "Keil Miller Jr" from https://github.com/keilmillerjr/shuffle-module   
NOTE: I have added shuffle plugin in the repo and download file because new users tend to make mistakes in placing modules/ plugins. The most updated version will always be at Keil's orignal page and I encourge all to use original shuffle repo for keeping the plugin updated and also keep an eye on Keil's other plugins which can add a lot of quality of life additions to Attract-Mode.

### Font
* Roboto: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto  
* Roboto-Light-Uppercase: Is a modified version of Roboto, edited by [FontForge](https://fontforge.github.io/en-US/) to only show Uppercase characters
