The romlists generated by Attract-Mode will be placed here. There are two types of romlists.

1- DisplaysMenu Lists: These are like parent folders which open up subfolders. These lists contain Systems/ displays (not games). These are in plain text. In this theme Arcades/ Computers/ Consoles/ Handhelds and Collections are DisplaysMenu lists. I have added these DisplaysMenu romlists listing all the systems supported by this theme. Rename if your Systems are named differently.

2- Game Romlists: These are actual gamelists, these are also in plain text.


Understanding Romlist Structure: In both these lists the first line is based on headers (actually taken from MAME) which are as follows: 
#Name;Title;Emulator;CloneOf;Year;Manufacturer;Category;Players;Rotation;Control;Status;DisplayCount;DisplayType;AltRomname;AltTitle;Extra;Buttons 

"#" at the start of a line means that Attract-Mode will ignore the line, since 1 line equals 1 system or 1 game you can manually add # to items you don't want displayed.

Name: Actual name of System or Game. For example if a ROM has the name "Mr. PacMan Adventures (Europe).bin" then this will be the name "Mr. PacMan Adventures (Europe)" i.e. the actual filename minus the extension.

Title: Title is the name you give the System/ ROM. In the above example you can change it to "Mr. PacMan Adventures" or simply "Mr. PacMan" - Titles are helpful because you can sort the lists through [Title] so e.g. if above title had a sequel "New Adventures of Mr. PacMan" you can use titles like "PacMan I - Mr. PacMan Adventures" & "PacMan II - New Adventures of PacMan" they will be listed togather in the romlist when sorted by title. 

Emulator: The emulator of the game, this equals the emulator name given in AM/emulators - i.e. If you named the emulator file for genesis "Sega Genesis.cfg" then this will be the value here for game romlists. for DisplaysMenu this will ALWAYS be @ 

CloneOf: MAME specific usage. You can use them as empty containers for other info (e.g. Region etc)

Year: Year of Release, can be used with both Games and Systems

Manufacturer: Manufacturer of Game/ System, again can be used by both Games and Systems

Category: Genre for Games (platform, action etc)

Players: # of players in Game

Rotation: MAME specific usage, can be used as empty container for rest

Control: MAME specific, can be used as empty container for rest

Status: MAME specific, can be used as empty container for rest

DisplayCount: MAME specific, can be used as empty container for rest

DisplayType: MAME specific, can be used as empty container for rest

AltRomname: MAME specific, can be used as empty container for rest

AltTitle: MAME specific, can be used as empty container for rest. Can be used for abbreviated names for Systems such as SNES.

Extra: MAME specific, can be used as empty container for rest. [Extra] is used for System information in this theme.

Buttons: MAME specific, can be used as empty container for rest

The empty containers you can use for other info. These are magic tokens and can easily be called anywhere in layout directly. You can use them for region, language, database etc. In this theme [Extra] lists the "?bit system" heading for DisplaysMenu items. If you change it make sure to add it under some other header and change the layout.nut accordingly.

Other notes: Names and Titles both relate to other artwork. [Title] is used for characters/logos/controllers & [Name] is used for [Overviews] in AM\scraper\@\overview. Any changes should be reflected accordingly.

Adding new Systems: New Systems will usually be either be Arcade, Computer, Console or Handheld. Simply add an entry in the relevant DisplayMenu list. Items should be listed alphabetically for better organization.

Adding new Collections/ genres: Make a new entry in Collections - The Collections list is also sorted alphabetically but uses a two tiered structure. Genres are listed first then game collections (series). In genres ALL comes first followed by the rest of the enteries in alphabetical order.

Adding New System romlist: Most often is generated through Attract-Mode - if a pre-made list is used then make sure the [Name] & [Title] structure discussed above is followed.
